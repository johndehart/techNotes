The list of digital Capability Development Document (CDD) Minimum Viable Product (MVP) streams identifies a large range of disciplines... system modeling, software development, data management, process design, user experience, and documentation. This will require a large cross functonal team:

### IDE SysML Model - Capability Requirements (This model focuses on requirments!!!)
1. Develop a Systems Modeling Language (SysML) model focusing on capability requirements. 
2. Validate model against existing mission objectives and stakeholder requirements.

### Software Development Plan (SDP)
1. Generate a Software Development Plan that outlines the development lifecycle, roles, technologies to be used, and quality assurance steps.

### Vending Machine Environment (VME) Infrastructure (VDI is a mitigation...)
1. Set up the VME for toolset deployment and development.

### Integrated Product and Mission Analysis (Domain)
1. Create integrated models covering mission objectives, including data models (both logical and physical), process models, toolsets, and deployment strategies.
2. Develop Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration and Modeling (AFSIM) scenarios focused on logistics, both stochastic and deterministic.

### Product Support Analysis (Domain)
1. Develop Object-oriented Process, Unified Shaping, and Integration Standard (OPUS) models for logistics. 
2. Create a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) roadmap for validation.
3. Identify use cases to support validation of the CDD.

### VR Visualization
1. Develop Interface Definition Document (IDD) for data streaming between Virtual Reality (VR) environments and other systems.
2. Develop VR scenarios specific to mission threads, document the development process.

### Model Based CDD
1. Define Systems Engineering processes specifically for CDD development.
2. Develop a Systems Modeling Language (SysML) schema for standardization ("Gold Standard").
3. Validate mission threads against this schema.

For each stream, we should also plan to:
1. Document the "gold standard" for model and scenario development.
2. Conduct user sessions for persona refinement and collect feedback.
3. Incorporate user feedback into models and documentation.

The focus needs to be on **interdependencies** between these streams, careful managment to make sure alignment with the overarching objectives and that the data and processes are consistent across all domains.


What is my DE Role:
1. Digital Integration: integration between various tools, data models, and architectures. Establish integration points and interfaces.
2. Data Management: Develop and maintain the data models.
3. Standards and Protocols: ensuring that data models, integration protocols, and software architectures are compliant with any of our standards. (Standards?, QA, CM, 15288???)
4. Technical Documentation: Any documentation outlining the digital architecture, data models, integration points, and protocols.
5. Quality Assurance: Implement quality checks for digital aspects of the project.
6. Stakeholder Communication: POC for digital aspects of the project, between MBSE + software + curatorial activities. (Internal and external...)
7. Technology Assessment: Evaluate and recommend digital tools and technologies that can benefit the project. (Domain specific for now)
8. Performance Metrics: Track and report on metrics related to the digital aspects of the project.
9. Change Management: Asess the impact of (or changes of) in digital requirements, tools, or data structures, and manage the transition smoothly. (Not own CM, we need a CM strategy at the program level)

## List of Potential Stories for Obliviate CR:
