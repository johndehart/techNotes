Given the complexity of the project and the specific MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) we have outlined, we should break them down into smaller, actionable tasks or user stories. MVPs need to be developed, tested, and validated in an iterative manner:

### MVP 1: Define Repeatable Approach within SEMAP
1. "As a systems engineer, I need a repeatable approach for development to be documented in the Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMAP) so that standardization is maintained."

### MVP 2: Implement Approach for Subset of ME Analysis
1. "As a mission engineer, I need the repeatable approach to be applied to a subset of Mission Engineering (ME) analysis and toolsets so that feasibility can be assessed."

### MVP 3: Validate Implemented Approach
1. "As a quality assurance engineer, I need to validate the implemented approach against the specified test case to ensure it meets functional requirements."

### MVP 4: Document Logical Integration of ME and SE Activities
1. "As a systems engineer, I need a document that details the logical integration between Mission Engineering (ME) and Systems Engineering (SE) activities to clarify workflow and collaboration."

### MVP 5: Document Physical (SW) Integration of ME and SE Toolsets
1. "As a software engineer, I need a document that details the physical software integration between ME and SE toolsets to ensure compatibility and interoperability."

### MVP 6: Develop Data Model and Analysis Approach Template
1. "As a data analyst, I need a template for a data model and analysis approach so that data dependencies are abstracted from the underlying toolsets."

### MVP 7: Demonstrate Toolset Integration via Service Bus (or even better a SOA set... ms)
1. "As a systems integrator, I need to demonstrate that toolsets for ME and SE can integrate through a service bus, thus removing point-to-point dependencies."

We can take these tasks/user stories and further decomposed into specific technical requirements, use cases, and criteria for acceptance tests, facilitating iterative development and continuous validation.
