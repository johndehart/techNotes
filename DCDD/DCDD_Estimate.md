Estimating the duration for such a complex, multidisciplinary project is diffcult due the interdependencies among team members, the complexity of integration, and of course bottlenecks. Here estimated timeline: (Based on streams)

### Assumptions:
1. DE 100%.
2. MBSE 75%.
3. SW Architect 50%.
4. Curator 25%.
5. Sprints are currently two weeks long but this can change.

### Estimate:

#### Develops Integrated CDD Capability Requirements
- DE + MBSE collaboration: 1-2 sprints

#### Designs Digital Toolset Integrated Architecture
- DE + SW Architect: 2-3 sprints

#### Develops Software Features for Domain Capabilities
- DE alone or with SW Architect: 2-4 sprints

#### Performs System-Level Validation and QA
- DE: 1-2 sprints

#### IDE Model: Logical Requirements/Architecture
- DE + MBSE: 2-3 sprints

#### Define Sequence Diagram Approach
- DE: 1 sprint

#### Conduct User Session for SEMAP
- DE: 1 sprint

#### Software Development: Establish Environment
- DE + SW Architect: 1-2 sprints

#### Release SDP
- DE: 1 sprint

#### Draft Initial Physical Architecture
- DE + MBSE + SW Architect: 2-3 sprints

### Total: 
- Roughly 14 to 25 sprints (â‰ˆ28 to 50 weeks) - does not account for bottlenecks, delays, or scope changes.

### Caveats:
- These estimates are subject to change based on real-world constraints, uncertainties, and the actual speed of development.
- Parallelization of work could significantly reduce the timeline.
- Availability constraints for team members may lead to bottlenecks.
- These estimates do not include time for reviews, revisions, or unexpected issues that may arise.

Coordinating between team members and domains will be a critical aspect to manage effectively to stay on schedule.
